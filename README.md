## Summary

This is an online tool for users of [Orbiter Space Flight Simulator](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) to create and share flight logs.

I see now that I ought to expand this theme to include any and all flight-simulators. The utility of this may be questionable for other sims though. Eventually, I would like users to be able to upload screenshots for logs or, even, replay-files (for user downloading). And there may be some usefulness searching a database for sims vs operating systems (review-wise). Maybe there should be a field for graphics processor?

Dealing strictly with [Orbiter](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/), however, this tool could be viable for pilots who want to document and share flight procedure. Currently, multiplayer capabilities are nearly non-existent in [Orbiter](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/). Space being big, enthusiasts... well, you know who you are... you might use this :)
